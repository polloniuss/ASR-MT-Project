# Datasets for Machine Translation

Each file contains two columns of strings separated by a whitespace.
The first column contains rows of ground truth sentences, the second column contains corresponding rows of performed sentences by Wac2Vec2 model.

- **train_truth_performed.csv** contains data from the training set.
- **train_truth_performed_errors_only.csv** contains non matching data (difference between ground truth and perfomed sentences) from the training set.
